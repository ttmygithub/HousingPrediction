Goal:
	A housing developer interest in acquiring properties in King County Washington. He wants to know what home features
(zip code, structure, and so on) would yield a high price. We have acquired the king county sold housing data 
from 2014 ~ 2015. It has 21613 records with 21 features.   By using this data set, we are going to answer this 
developer's questions.  Eg: Which zip code/house structure will help him make the most money.

Though process and methods : Clean the data set to remove the outliers.  Consolidate data (bathroom, view) to categories.
			     Create additional data columns to help for chart displays and aggregating data count.
                             Show different charts to see how features (price, bedroom, bathroom, and etc) correlated to one another.
	                     Summarize the findings and recommendation for housing developers. 

Python Libraries used in this project: pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot


Run: The data set is in "https://library.startlearninglabs.uw.edu/DATASCI410/Datasets/kc_house_data.csv". 
     The notebook can be run using jupyter notebook.
